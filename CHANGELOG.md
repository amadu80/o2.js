**[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** Change Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.26

v.0.26 is not up there yet. Here are a few major things that will change most of the
codebase:

- We'll be removing active support of IE versions less than 10
- We'll be using an AMD approach (either using require.js or a custom AMD implementation
that supports (or is similar to) require.js API

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.25

* Still work in progress.
* There are lots of patches to add.
* Unit tests are being written from the grounds up.

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.24

* This version has been actually used in a **mobile** and **desktop** app
production environments (for <http://grou.ps/> mobile and desktop apps, that
has been used and tested by hundreds of thousands of users).
The code is improved and got fixed by looking at user feedback and bug reports
accordingly. I'd like to thank <http://grou.ps> once more for their support
in **open source** development.
* Many stability improvments have been done.
* Created a set of unit test, that can be run automatically before each
major release.
