Part 2:

---- supporting text -------

- cross-domain messaging alternatives (klein bottle)
- (at any phase mention all approaches and use the simplest one)


--- supporting text ---

first (ideal case)
    authenticate user,
    remember the user.


a node.js application that
1. asks for credentials of the user.
2. displays logged in gui
3. resdisplays the logged in gui after refresh
4. the gui will have name surname and details of the user and an editable
text area
5. the text will update after user tpyes stuff
6. refreshing will retrieve the updated text from server.


- ideal case: 3rd party cookies are enabled
- detect whether they are enabled
- if disabled
    use cross frame messaging api if supported
    otherwise use klein bottle.

    mention that these should be enough and cross frame messaging api appears
    to be more widely supported in the future.

    mention easyxdm as well.


my next blog post will be about JS widgets for external sites.


TODO: look at notational data links as well.
