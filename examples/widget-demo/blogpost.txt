How to Create JavaScript Widgets for External Sites
===================================================

What is a JavaScript Widget?
----------------------------

A JavaScript Widget can be defined as any type of functionality that can be
loaded from an external site (publisher), to different sites (subscribers) that
include the widget code via a simple JavaScript include.

A JavaScript Widget may or may not include a GUI counterpart. An exmaple of
a JavaScript Widget that does not contain a GUI counterpart is google analytics
code that most of us is familiar with.

Also a JavaScript widget can have state information (persist session state
on the publisher servers), it can send data to the publisher website, and it
can receive data from the publisher website.

There are many challenges one can face when developing a JavaScript Widget.
To name a few:

<insert challenges here>



> When you don't own the DOM, really careful you should be.


--- supporting text ---

first (ideal case)
    authenticate user,
    remember the user.


a node.js application that
1. asks for credentials of the user.
2. displays logged in gui
3. resdisplays the logged in gui after refresh
4. the gui will have name surname and details of the user and an editable
text area
5. the text will update after user tpyes stuff
6. refreshing will retrieve the updated text from server.


- ideal case: 3rd party cookies are enabled
- detect whether they are enabled
- if disabled
    use cross frame messaging api if supported
    otherwise use klein bottle.

    mention that these should be enough and cross frame messaging api appears
    to be more widely supported in the future.

    mention easyxdm as well.


my next blog post will be about JS widgets for external sites.


TODO: look at notational data links as well.

2. Typical Use Cases for JavaScript Widgets

3. Challenges
- unknown context
- shared enviroment (override undefined)
- shared DOM
- cross domain restrictions
- third party cookie restrictions
- async script include
- cross-domain messaging alternatives (klein bottle)
- (at any phase mention all approaches and use the simplest one)

Minification

split into logical pieces,
use modules

do use namespaces --
