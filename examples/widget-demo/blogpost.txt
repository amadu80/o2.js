Part 6:
    First some refactoring...

publish/subscribe is a bit like explosives. In the hands of thoughtful experts, you can expect to have a sky scraper demolished safely and in a reasonable time frame. In the hands of amateurs, working with explosives, you’ll end up with some very noisy and messy situations when you least expect it. And sure, every once in a while, even experts make mistakes.

two things, helper libs and wd modules
= raise events for cross-module messaging
= use helper libraries


    {{handling sessions}}
    {{how to authenticate user}}
    {{third party cookies}}

    TODO: add a references section
        - Ben and Anthon's book was helpul
        - So as Steve's articles
        - list a bunch of links that may be good for further reading.

Part 7:

    {{retrieving data from server, modifying it, persisting it to server}}

Part 8:
    preparing for production.
    {{Deployment and Minification}}
    {{Versioning}}


---- supporting text -------

- cross-domain messaging alternatives (klein bottle)
- (at any phase mention all approaches and use the simplest one)

http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/05/22/self-updating-scripts/

caching issues:
A bootstrap script is defined as a 3rd party script with a hardwired URL that can’t be changed. We want to give these scripts long cache times so they don’t slow down the page, but we also want the cached version to get updated when there’s a change. There are two main problems to solve: notifying the browser when there’s an update, and replacing the cached bootstrap script with the new version.
via:

--- supporting text ---

first (ideal case)
    authenticate user,
    remember the user.

seamless iframes:
    http://benvinegar.github.com/seamless-talk/#/39
    for those who want consistent styling and a stricter control in a
    well-defined sandbox environment.

a node.js application that
1. asks for credentials of the user.
2. displays logged in gui
3. resdisplays the logged in gui after refresh
4. the gui will have name surname and details of the user and an editable
text area
5. the text will update after user tpyes stuff
6. refreshing will retrieve the updated text from server.


- ideal case: 3rd party cookies are enabled
- detect whether they are enabled
- if disabled
    use cross frame messaging api if supported
    otherwise use klein bottle.

    mention that these should be enough and cross frame messaging api appears
    to be more widely supported in the future.

    mention easyxdm as well.


my next blog post will be about JS widgets for external sites.


TODO: look at notational data links as well.


1. What is a JavaScript Widget

2. Typical Use Cases for JavaScript Widgets

3. Challenges


Minification

split into logical pieces,
use modules
-- give examples


do use namespaces --
