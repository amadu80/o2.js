## About o2.js

Hi, I'm [1][Volkan Özçelik].

Front-end development and performance optimization has always been my passion.
With [2][o2.js], I aim to reflect this passion.

I have three main goals for [2][o2.js]:

* [2][o2.js] will be **fast**,
* [2][o2.js] will be **flexible**,
* [2][o2.js] will be **reliable**.

> "In the land of heavy JavaScript libraries,
> o2.js will be like fresh oxygen **;)**."

[2][o2.js] is in still in its growth phase with a pretty stable code base.

## Yet Another JavaScript Framework?! Seriously?

Well, [2][o2.js] is not and end-result. It is a **"by-product"**.
Let me explain:

Up till now, I've used various **JavaScript** techniques, analyzed and used
almost all of the popular **JavaScript** frameworks, and have built a dozen
of **JavaScript** libraries, from the ground up, myself.

In that regard, my aim was **NOT** to develop yet another **JavaScript**
framework. Per contra, my goal was to blog about peculiarities,
intricacies, best-practices, patterns, use-cases, implementations of
re-usable, cross-platform, optimized **JavaScript** code at <http://o2js.com/>.

As a result, at <http://o2js.com/> I dived deep into the realm of
**JavaScript**, while trying to seek out library-independent solutions,
sharing my experiences along the way. I still actively blog and continue
sharing my knowledge and experience [2][there].

Ironically enough, while blogging at <http://o2js.com>, I realized that the code
snippets that I was mixing together as blog posts were evolving into a solid
and re-usable **JavaScript** *framework*.

Hope you like the outcome ;).



## Supported Platforms & User Agents

[2][o2.js] is being designed to run pretty smoothly in almost any device/user
agent. What makes this possible is the fact that [2][o2.js] utilizes modern
features whenever possible, while gracefully degrading to slower alternatives
for the less capable browsers.

For instance, [2][o2.js] **DomHelper** selectors will try to use
*DOM Level 2* *native* **querySelector** method if available, and will fall back
to a good-old for loop otherwise.

[2][o2.js] is constantly being developed keeping backwards compatibility in
mind. Before each major release, [2][o2.js]  will be unit-tested in **at least**
the following browsers/platforms:

* **IE6 Windows** (and above)
* **Firefox/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Opera/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Google Chrome/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Firefox/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Opera/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Google Chrome/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Safari/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
