About **[o2.js][2]**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[o2.js][2]** is a **JavaScript** Framework that's constantly evolving with
three main goals:

* **[o2.js][2]** will be **fast**,
* **[o2.js][2]** will be **flexible**,
* **[o2.js][2]** will be **reliable**.

> "In the land of heavy JavaScript libraries,
> o2.js will be like fresh oxygen **;)**."

**[o2.js][2]** is in still in its growth phase with a pretty stable code base.

Yet Another JavaScript Framework?! Seriously?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have to admit, **JavaScript**, in its native form is far from being perfect.
That's why there are so many frameworks around. Some of these frameworks provide
an **API** or **[Façade][4]** to query, manipulate and animate **DOM**, while
some of these frameworks extend the native **JavaScript** objects with a bunch
of useful functions and methods.

**[o2.js][2]** is somewhere in the middle. Actually, **[o2.js][2]** is not
and end-result. It is a **"by-product"**:

> Up till now, I've used various **JavaScript** techniques, analyzed and used
> almost all of the popular **JavaScript** frameworks, and have built a dozen
> of **JavaScript** libraries, from the ground up, myself.
>
> In that regard, my aim was **NOT** to develop yet another **JavaScript**
> framework. Per contra, my goal was to blog about peculiarities,
> intricacies, best-practices, patterns, use-cases, implementations of
> re-usable, cross-platform, optimized **JavaScript** code at
> <http://o2js.com/>.
>
> As a result, at <http://o2js.com/> I dived deep into the realm of
> **JavaScript**, trying to seek out library-independent solutions,
> and sharing my experiences along the way. I still actively blog and continue
> sharing my knowledge and experience [there][2].
>
> Ironically enough, while blogging at <http://o2js.com>, I realized that the
> code snippets that I was mixing together as blog posts were evolving into
> a solid and re-usable **JavaScript** *framework*.

Hope you like the outcome **;)**.

Supported Platforms & User Agents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[o2.js][2]** is being designed to run pretty smoothly in almost any
device/useragent. What makes this possible is the fact that **[o2.js][2]**
utilizes modern features whenever possible, while gracefully degrading to slower
alternatives for the less capable browsers.

For instance, **[o2.js][2]** **DomHelper** selectors will try to use
*DOM Level 2* *native* **querySelector** method if available, and will fall back
to a good-old for loop otherwise.

**[o2.js][2]** is constantly being developed keeping backwards compatibility in
mind. Before each major release, **[o2.js][2]** will be unit-tested in
**at least** the following browsers/platforms:

* **IE6 Windows** (and above)
* **Firefox/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Opera/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Google Chrome/Linux** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Firefox/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Opera/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Google Chrome/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
* **Safari/Windows** (the Most Recent Stable Version)
