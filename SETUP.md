# o2.js Development Environment Setup

To test the examples you will need a **LAMP** (or **WAMP**) stack.

Just copy the contens of this folder to **http://localhost/o2.js/**
(i.e.: http://localhost/o2.js/**SETUP.md** should point to this **SETUP.md**
file you are currently viewing.)

To build documentation, `cd` to **"batch"** folder and run `publish.sh`.
